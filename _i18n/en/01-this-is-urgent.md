# This is Urgent

> “The pervasive and wide ranging effects of the global pandemic has put Canadian communities in crisis. Our ability to recover will be driven by the generosity and kindness of Canadians as we restore public health and engage in an inclusive economy. I am happy to support a well-informed sectoral conversation to increase the disbursement quota and advance community impact more holistically, recognizing the urgency of the moment.”

COVID-19 has exposed the growing “charity gap” between what is required to help those in need and the funding available to support them. Donations from individual Canadians are down, while demands on social services continue to rise. 

Governments have already taken on significant deficits and accumulated debt throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Raising taxes is a sub-optimal approach to meet this additional need, as it would hurt the already struggling economy. 

On the other hand, charitable foundations in Canada have doubled their financial assets over the past 6 years, from $40 Billion to over $80 Billion dollars. This represents an average of 12% growth per year, which is well above inflation and the growth of Canada’s GDP. Over the same period of time, the ratio of money granted from foundations to charities has decreased year-after-year. While wealth is accumulating in investment accounts, foundations are not voluntarily stepping up to put it to good use.

Many Canadians do not realize that for every dollar donated to a foundation, the donor receives a charity tax credit. These tax credits come out of our government public purse, which could otherwise have been directed towards other public benefits. 

Given that foundations are partly funded by our tax dollars, we have the right to express how we want them to operate. It is against the best interest of Canadian taxpayers to have their money locked up in perpetuity in foundations. It is our right to expect stronger policies in the interest of the greater good. Delayed good is less good. We cannot undo the suffering of those in need or reverse damage to our environment after the fact. We need to address our struggles sooner before they compound.
