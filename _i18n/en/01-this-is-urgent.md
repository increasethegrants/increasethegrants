# This is Urgent

COVID-19 has exposed the growing “charity gap” between what is required to help those in need and the funding available to support them. Donations from individual Canadians are down, while demands on social services continue to rise. 

Governments have already taken on significant deficits and accumulated debt throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Raising taxes is a sub-optimal approach to meet this additional need, as it hurts the already struggling economy. 

On the other hand, charitable foundations in Canada have doubled their financial assets over the past 6 years, from $40 Billion to over $80 Billion dollars. This represents an average of 12% growth per year, which is well above inflation and the growth of Canada’s GDP. Over the same period of time, the ratio of money granted from foundations to charities has decreased year-after-year. While wealth is accumulating in investment accounts, foundations are not voluntarily stepping up to put it to good use.

Many Canadians do not realize that for every dollar donated into a foundation, the donor gets a charity tax credit. These tax credits come out of our government public purse, which could otherwise have been directed towards other public benefits. 

Given that they are partly funded by our tax dollars, we have the right to express how we want foundations to operate. It is against the best interest of Canadian taxpayers to have their money locked up in perpetuity in foundations. It is our right to expect stronger policies in the interest of the greater good. Delayed good is less good. We cannot undo the suffering of those in need or reverse damage to our environment after the fact. We need to address our struggles sooner before they compound. 

We need a federal policy to reduce the hoarding of money in foundations by requiring greater granting to struggling charities This can be done by increasing the **distribution quota (DQ)**, which is the minimum percentage of assets that charitable foundations must disburse to charities and other programs each year in order to retain their non-profit status. We propose starting with a 5-year pilot test requiring foundations to return to granting 10% of their assets each year, and then measuring the impact that this change has on philanthropy. 
  
A 10% distribution quota is a very reasonable request:
 
* The average level of granting by foundations has been about 7-8% of total assets in the last few years.
* Foundations averaged above 10% as recently as 2008 and 2011. 
* Many foundations already meet or exceed this quota. Requiring a higher DQ is not a significant change for many. This stronger regulation is necessary for those that contribute closer to the minimum.
* This ratio has been declining over the past 10 years at the same time that assets have been steadily increasing in Foundations. 
* This small percentage increase would mean that an additional $4 billion dollars would be granted to registered charities, each year.
* Since the financial markets average about 6-8% increase annually, a 10% DQ would not significantly reduce Foundation investments.   

There is a real urgency to act now! Many Canadians are struggling as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is not the time for charitable foundations to sit back and accumulate wealth. We need to build awareness and turn up the pressure on our elected officials to make the 10% distribution quota a reality. We need YOUR voice, today.
