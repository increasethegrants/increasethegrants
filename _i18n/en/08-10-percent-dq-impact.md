## Impacts of a 10% Disbursement Quota

Raising the minimum disbursement requirement in Canada to 10% would offer a balance between accomplishing greater good, sooner, and allowing foundations to have enough longevity to serve their important role. A 10% DQ would:

* Quickly redirect billions of additional dollars, annually, to the aid of charities without an additional cost to our government budgets. The money is already available (post-tax credits). 
* Minimally impact the majority of foundations that already grant near or above the suggested 10% DQ. This primarily encourages more generosity from foundations that grant amounts closer to the minimum (3.5%) and bring down the average.
* Help alleviate the massive funding pressure which many charitable organizations are currently experiencing. 
* Ensure that current taxpayers see the benefits of the lost tax revenue within their own lifetimes. 

More money, sooner, means greater good sooner. The quicker we can address social issues, accelerate medical research, improve our environment, etc. the sooner we will reap the benefits. Holding back charity grants for 25+ years allows problems to compound. Potential donors to such foundations would likely appreciate a greater portion of their dollars being used right away to make an impact. Donors give, in large part, because they want to see their gift make a difference. **A 10% DQ may be more motivational for many philanthropists.** 

Concerns for future philanthropy should not be a reason to delay a greater good now. Every generation creates both new wealth and new philanthropists (think Balsillie, Gates, Buffet, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and so on). The rapid accumulation of assets in foundations over the past decade is not due to the existence of old foundations, but a recent phenomenon of new and/or living philanthropists. 

Furthermore, as Baby Boomers continue to age, there is a significant amount of money likely to be donated over the next 10 to 30 years. There is every reason to believe that new charitable dollars will be available to continue supporting the charities of future generations. And if there are no future philanthropists, then this is the shortcoming of future generations, not something that should disadvantage current taxpayers.
