## About the Disbursement Quota
 
The Disbursement Quota (DQ) is defined as the amount that foundations must disburse annually from their assets to either qualified registered Canadian charities, or to their own charitable programs. The rest is usually invested in financial markets to grow the endowment over time.

The original purpose of the disbursement quota (as of 1950) was:  **(1) To prevent excessive capital accumulation**, and (2) to help restrict fundraising costs. The original DQ called for foundations to disburse 90% of the donated funds from the previous year in the following year. 

In the 1970s, the federal government was convinced to calculate the DQ as a basis of the foundation’s assets, originally set at 5.0% of assets. Over time, the government was encouraged to further reduce the DQ to 4.5%, and then again to reduce it to the current 3.5% of assets. 

Note how the 1976 Budget Paper setting the new DQ at 5% recognized the impact of charitable giving on taxpayers:

> The purposes of the proposed changes were to ensure that tax-exempt monies flowing to charities are used as intended, as efficiently as possible, [...] **Because revenue forgone as a result of deductions or exemptions […] impose an equivalent extra tax burden on all other taxpayers.**
>
>... Every dollar of tax relief represents a cost to the Canadian taxpayer, and the government therefore believes that it is appropriate that **the rules of taxation ensure that the people of Canada obtain maximum benefit from the charities.** 

Many of the arguments for further reducing the DQ seem to have been based on the need to preserve capital in the foundations in order to benefit from the performance of the financial markets. This is where our policies lost sight of the purpose of foundations and their duty to taxpayers. Foundations do not exist to outperform the financial markets nor to accumulate money in perpetuity. They exist as ‘agents’ of the government to provide social services and charitable good, so that “the people of Canada obtain the maximum benefit” for our tax dollars.

In summary, the role of foundations is to distribute funds in the interest of public good. The DQ was designed to prevent the accumulation of wealth, and to respect the will of taxpayers. Tying the DQ to the average returns of financial markets is a red herring. It is the agenda of foundation boards to have this comparison, which does not reflect the purpose of the DQ policy nor the interest of taxpayers.
