## About This Initiative

> “For the benefit of many Canadians struggling and in need of a helping hand, charitable foundations must be required to grant more of their expanding wealth. Delayed good is less good. I hope this initiative succeeds. So many Canadians need this to happen.”

\#IncreaseTheGrants is a volunteer driven movement founded and supported largely by John Hallward, a retired entrepreneur, a public opinion researcher, and volunteer to several registered charities. After years of work to encourage Canadians to donate to charity - including bringing *[Giving Tuesday](https://givingtuesday.ca/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}* to Canada (with CanadaHelps) - John identified the systemic choke-point in our charitable system: the accumulation of cash by foundations and donor-advised funds. Working with friends, both new and old, John is building a movement to help fix this problem to better serve struggling Canadian charities, the millions of Canadians in need of help, and for the millions of Canadian taxpayers who want to see their tax dollars put to good use. 

[//]: <> In January 2021, John, alongside prominent Canadians, published an open letter in the *Globe and Mail* calling for an increase to the required Disbursement Quota among foundations. Below is the content of the letter, and the names of Canadians who have signed on.

This effort is supported by this website and social engagement efforts to help bring greater awareness to these issues and to help encourage our elected officials to act. Other than the costs to the contractors who have helped to bring this initiative to life, neither John nor other supportive Canadians are receiving any money or financial gain. Instead, supporters volunteer their time, talent, and/or financial support to fight for better public policy for struggling charities and the millions of Canadians that depend on them.
