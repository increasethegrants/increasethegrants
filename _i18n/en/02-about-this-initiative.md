## About this Initiative

Based on Ipsos research<sup><a href="https://sector3insights.com/products/canadianis-understanding-and-opinions-of-charitable-foundations" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, it is clear that Canadians have two fundamental perspectives about charitable foundations:

1. Foundations play an important role and should exist, and 
2. Foundations should be more transparent, be more accountable, and be required to grant more money, sooner.
 
Several articles have been published in support of increasing the required “distribution quota” of charitable foundations<sup><a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/may-2020/unlocking-the-expanding-wealth-of-charitable-foundations/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.thecharityreport.com/features/dq-increase-adds-billions-to-the-charity-economy/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>. Ottawa has heard the call to do so, but so far our federal government has been silent on this topic. Because this is an issue of taxpayer dollars and how they are being used, it is now the responsibility of engaged voters and taxpayers to make their expectations known to the government.

One might think that struggling charities should be leading this initiative, but they are in a precarious situation. The vast majority of charities receive funding from one or more foundations. In turn, they dare not bite the hand that feeds them, even if they agree with the initiative or desperately need the additional funding. As such, we need informed citizens to step up to demand more from our government and foundations on behalf of charities.

A small “coalition of the caring” has worked to launch this website and public campaign. We are a group of well-informed individual Canadian citizens who have explored the issue and wish to fight in support of struggling Canadians. We believe that we should all have a say in how our taxes are spent, and on the policies that govern the charities and foundations that are funded through our tax dollars. We understand the important role of foundations but feel that they should be held to a higher standard in exchange for the tax deductions and exemptions that they receive. 

This initiative to “increase the grants” is simply a pursuit to do what is right to help struggling charities, and struggling Canadians in need. This website and the associated public campaign aim to raise awareness of the benefits of increasing the ”Distribution Quota” of foundations to 10% and to raise public support to make this a reality. 

No profits will be taken from this enterprise. Some contractors will be paid, but everyone else is doing this voluntarily. All funds collected from interested and like-minded people will be used to promote and expand the reach of this campaign across Canada.
