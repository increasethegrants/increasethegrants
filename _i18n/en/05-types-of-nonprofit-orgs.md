## Types of Non-Profit Organizations

The non-profit sector in Canada is large; it employs millions, and serves millions more. These organizations define our communities and the type of society we enjoy. They are key to our quality of life. Despite the simple idea of doing/being good, the sector is quite complex and confusing. Here is a quick summary:

* (1)  Registered Charities + Foundations 
    
    Organizations approved by the Canada Revenue Agency to receive charitable donations and issue charity tax credit receipts. They all play a role in benefitting society. There are two types of Registered organizations:
    * (1a) Charities.

        Charities tend to apply all of their annual funding towards helping deliver their services for public good.<br>
        Notable charities include United Way, Salvation Army, Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, etc.

        <em>**Many of these are struggling to help Canadians due to a lack of money, and an increase in need/demand.**</em>

    * (1b)  Foundations

        Foundations tend to collect and hold funds in their investment accounts and distribute a small percentage of their assets each year to help registered charities or engage their own charitable programs. Foundations may be classified as either “public” or “private”, depending on the relationship of their board members and their sources of funding.<br>
        Notable foundations include: The MasterCard Foundation, The Chagnon Foundation, The Azrieli Foundation, The David Suzuki Foundation.
        
        <em>**This class of  foundations are collectively sitting on $80+ Billion, and growing.**</em> 

* (2) Other non-profit organizations/ associations 
These tend to be community centres, clubs, union associations, etc. These organizations cannot offer charity tax receipts. They tend to charge fees for memberships, and/or sell products and services to support their operating costs.
