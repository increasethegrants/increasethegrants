## The Growing Charity Gap
 
For several years, Canada has been facing a growing ‘charity gap’. This is a financial gap between available funding and the growing costs of services that maintain civility and equity in our communities. These services support the elderly, the homeless, abuse victims, animal welfare, environmental health, medical research, and numerous other critical issues.

This gap is widening due to many reasons, including:

* The expansion of the Canadian population, with the corresponding increase in demand for our social services. Simply stated, Canada has been growing. 
* The growing economic challenges on the middle- and lower-income levels, increasing demands on social services,  
* Declining charitable giving behaviour (on an inflation-adjusted, per capita basis).

In a recent Ipsos Canada poll (April 23-26, 2020)*;
* 48% of Canadian adults were aware of this widening charity gap. 
* When made aware of this fact, 71% of Canadians felt that this widening charity gap was not acceptable.
