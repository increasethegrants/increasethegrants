## Charities and Foundations Exist as an Extension of Government
 
> "I believe that our current disbursement quota of only 3.5% is bad public policy. Our government gives donors a sizable tax break to start a foundation and then only requires that 3.5 cents of every dollar donated is actually put to use every year to benefit society. That seems like a bad deal for society to me particularly at a time like this when the needs are so great. It needs to be increased significantly.”

Though our governments are ultimately responsible for the well-being of the nation, parts of this responsibility have been outsourced to charities and foundations which provide social services on the government’s behalf. To help ensure the success of charities and foundations, governments offer charity tax credits to donors to incentivize charitable giving to these organizations. Furthermore, policies allow investments to grow in these organizations exempt from income and capital gain taxes. 
	
Foundations play an important role. They can act independently of government bureaucracy, make decisions free of the politics of elected officials, take risks government departments avoid, address problems which may not be politically popular, and think about longer-term solutions which extend beyond the next election cycle. Foundations’ endowments also help smooth out funding to charities across fluctuations in the economy and financial markets. 

The use of the non-profit sector as a complement to government services appears to be a smart approach. It is more attractive than raising taxes. Philanthropy encourages voluntary charitable giving, which likely exceeds what taxes could extract from philanthropists. It is likewise much more rewarding for philanthropists to donate money willingly. We should be happy to accept their generosity.

**In simple terms, charities and foundations exist, leveraging our taxes, because the electorate has chosen to accept this approach. In turn, these organizations are accountable to voters and taxpayers.** 
 
However, we need greater accountability. Since taxpayer money is being used to empower foundations, we need better requirements, transparency, and accountability from them. We need our governments to exercise stronger controls to ensure that these foundations are meeting the needs and wishes of the electorate and do so in a timely manner.
