hero:
  struggling: Canadians are struggling.<br>Charities are struggling to help them.<br>... While Charitable Foundations are sitting  on $80+ billion.
  policy: A simple government policy change requiring foundations to contribute 10% of their assets each year to the charities that they support would release an extra <em>$4 billion</em> per year for struggling Canadian charities and the people that they serve.
  you: You can help make this happen!<br>We need your voice (not your money).
