  struggling: Canadians are struggling.<br>Charities are struggling to help them.<br>Meanwhile, charitable foundations are sitting on $80+ billion.
  policy: We need the Canadian Government to require greater distribution quotas from charitable foundations.
  grants: If foundations contributed 10% of their assets each year, that would mean an extra <em>$4 billion</em> per year for Canadian charities and the people that they serve.
  you: You can help make this happen.<br>We need your voice (not your money!)
